# pokemon_js
This is an HTML code for a Pokedex guide webpage.

It includes a title, a search bar with a search button, and a container for the Pokedex.

The page also includes links to external stylesheets and scripts.

To make the webpage functional, you would need to write the necessary JavaScript code in the "main.js" file and the CSS styling in the "style.css" file.

Additionally, you would need to link those files to the HTML using the appropriate file paths.
